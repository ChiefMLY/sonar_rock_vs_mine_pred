# Rock vs Mine Sonar Prediction

## The aim of this project is to create and train a model using the dataset obtained from the link above that can predict if the data provided is a Rock or Mine

The Model Accuracy score on the training dataset was: 0.8342245989304813
The Model Accuracy score on the test dataset was: 0.7619047619047619

The Predictive system created with the trained model was able to correctly label data that was passed to it from the data set
